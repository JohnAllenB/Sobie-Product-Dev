* The links above are the two main things I used to create the dev team card. This card shows all the name and links to their Github pages to give credit to those who put work into this product. When Dr. Cumbie brought this idea up I jumped on it because it was the last thing of front-end / UI programming that needed to be done. I have alwaus been more interest in generating pleasing UIs and so being a team for back-end work I left fast and started the team card. The steps I took to get to the finished product are below:

Created Issue 92 w/ new branch
Gathered the Github profile homepages of the classmates (Dev Team)
worked with README team to collaborate what information they will provide in wiki
Created an outside repo to work on html/css - https://github.com/JohnAllenB/sobie-dev-credits
Copied over my style sheet into public/styles and html into sobie-team.ejs
Adjusted sobie-footer href link to read sobie-team.ejs
Adjusted app.js to read from /sobie-team
Still need to push to main
