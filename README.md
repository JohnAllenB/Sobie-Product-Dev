Contributions
1. Sobie Dev Team Card

* https://github.com/barrycumbie/sobieconference.org/issues/92

* The links above are the two main things I used to create the dev team card. This card shows all the name and links to their Github pages to give credit to those who put work into this product. When Dr. Cumbie brought this idea up I jumped on it because it was the last thing of front-end / UI programming that needed to be done. I have alwaus been more interest in generating pleasing UIs and so being a team for back-end work I left fast and started the team card. The steps I took to get to the finished product are below:

- Created Issue 92 w/ new branch
- Gathered the Github profile homepages of the classmates (Dev Team)
- worked with Scrum team to collaborate what information they will provide in wiki
- Created an outside repo to work on html/css - https://github.com/JohnAllenB/sobie-dev-credits
- Copied over my style sheet into public/styles and html into sobie-team.ejs
- Adjusted sobie-footer href link to read sobie-team.ejs
- Adjusted app.js to read from /sobie-team
- Still need to push to main

* Pictures are attached to the bottom of this README to show progress of the dev team card and how the program was incorporated into the main branch.

2. Cordanation with Scrum team
* https://github.com/barrycumbie/sobieconference.org/wiki/Meet-the-Team

* This contribution included Nesia and me working together to see how we want to link the dev team to SOBIE. We ended up decdiing to keep the page I had created and intergrate it into the webpage and them to make a wiki with more links and still a full list of names of who wanted to be credited.

3. Infrastructure Team
* My time on this team was short lived because we split from teams two days into me being placed into the team. While on the team I learned what Johnny and Levon were trying to achieve connecting the frontend to backend. They really had a good grib on what they wanted so I just took task as they were given to me. I helped Johnny get database access by approaching the datebase team to get his account. I also generated a backend render the team used to test connections between front and backends.

4. Issue cards to generate ideas of changes we can make
* https://github.com/barrycumbie/sobieconference.org/issues/35
* https://github.com/barrycumbie/sobieconference.org/issues/24
* https://github.com/barrycumbie/sobieconference.org/issues/80
* https://github.com/barrycumbie/sobieconference.org/issues/92

5. I am going to be honest I really only can think of these four contributions. I wish I would have dug deeper into this project but the day we got split into teams I was actually absent because my car broke down. I feel like I would have done more if I got in a group that interested me or a group I had more knowledge on the end goal. Either way I feel like my team card page is good work for the project to show off the wonderful classmates and the hard work they put into this product.
